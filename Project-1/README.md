# a description of how you tested your code
These are the steps of how I tested my code:
Testing with valid input:
The code was first tested using valid inputs, to ensure that it was functioning as intended. The input data was entered into the code, and the output was verified to be correct. The results were compared to expected values, and any discrepancies were analyzed to determine if there was a problem with the code.

Verifying appropriate answer:
Once the valid inputs had been successfully tested, the output was checked to ensure that it was appropriate for the input. Any necessary adjustments were made to the code.

Testing with incorrect input:
After verifying that the code was functioning properly with valid input, testing was then shifted to using incorrect input. This was done to ensure that the code did not break and was still functioning as intended.

Checking that code is not breaking:
During the testing with incorrect input, the code was checked to ensure that it did not break or produce any errors. Any errors or issues that were identified were analyzed and resolved.

Playing around in terminal:
Finally, the code was played around with in the terminal to ensure that it was functioning properly in different scenarios.

# Implemented extensions ----please use readme file from my gradescope submission, here it changes formate of code I pasted for guidance of these extensions.
# 1) drop
The drop extension is designed to provide players with the ability to remove items from their inventory. This can be useful in situations where the player no longer needs the item or wants to free up space in their inventory. The drop extension is described as the opposite of the "get" functionality, which is typically used to add items to a player's inventory. The drop extension, on the other hand, allows the player to remove items from their inventory.
Before an item can be dropped, it needs to be in the player's inventory. If it does not exist in their inventory, the drop command will promp appropriate message that player is not carrying that item.

These are the following steps through you can test this extension :
1) started game - which lend player in first room and printed details of first room.

# 2) Winning and loosing condition.
below are the conditions of winning and loosing the game.

In this game, the player needs to collect one or more items from each room and maintain their health above 100. They also need to find the secret key to enter the monster's room, which will only be visible after collecting the key. If the player reaches the monster's room with less than 100 health, they will lose the game, even if they have collected all the required items.

There are three types of items in the game: weapons, food items, and random items. To eat the food item you have to have get the food item in you inventory. And only food items can increase the player's health, and if the player tries to eat anything else, the game will display an appropriate message.

To win the game, the player needs to collect all the necessary items while maintaining their health above 100. They also need to find the secret key and the monster's room, which will only be visible after collecting the key. If the player fails to collect all the necessary items, cannot find the secret key and the monster's room, or reaches the monster's room with less than 100 health, they will lose the game. Therefore, the key to winning the game is careful exploration, management of health, and finding the necessary items and the monster's room.

secret key is : "geheimer-schlussel" in red room

# 3) Abbreviations for verbs, directions, and items
It is common for text adventures to accept abbreviated forms of commands: for example, i might suffice to indicate inventory. It’s important that abbreviations only work when they are unambiguous: if you just typed g, would that indicate get or go?

example of Abbreviations can be seen in above example.
